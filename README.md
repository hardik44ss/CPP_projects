# 💻 C++ Projects from 1st Year 🚀

This repository contains the C++ projects I worked on during my 1st year of engineering. Each project helped me enhance my programming skills, ranging from managing book inventory to building a password generator.

## 📂 Projects Overview

- **📘 BookInventory.cpp**: A project to manage the inventory of a bookstore. This program allows adding, deleting, and searching for books in the inventory.
  
- **🏪 BookShop.cpp**: Simulates a bookshop where users can buy and sell books. The project manages transactions and stock updates.

- **📋 FinalProject(2ndSem).cpp**: This is my final project from the 2nd semester, encapsulating all that I learned in C++ during the year.

- **🔑 PasswordGenerator.cpp**: A fun project to generate random and secure passwords based on user requirements (length).

- **📝 Resume(2st Sem).cpp & Resume2(2ndSem).cpp**: These programs help automate the creation of a resume using structured data inputs and text formatting.

## 🎯 What I Learned

- Basic file handling and operations in C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- Data structures like arrays, strings, and lists
- Use of loops, functions, and conditionals to solve real-world problems

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **C++**: Core programming language for all projects.
- **IDE**: CodeBlocks/Dev C++ for compiling and running the programs.

## 💡 Next Steps

In future projects, I aim to work more on advanced topics such as:
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- File Streams and Handling
- Data Structures and Algorithms

Feel free to explore the code and leave any feedback or suggestions!
